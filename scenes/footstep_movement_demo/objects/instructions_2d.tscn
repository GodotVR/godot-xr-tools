This scene demonstrates the footstep system.
It works with the movement of the player and responds to the jumping and crouching movement as well.

Usage:
-movement_footstep.tscn
	this node needs to be attached to the XROrigin3D node,
	it is responsible for detecting the surface the player is
	currently standing on.
	
- surface_audio.tscn
	this is the node you can attach to a StaticBody
	which lets you define the surface audio resource
	
	1) select a StaticBody and attach
	a surface_audio.tscn to it
	
	2) select Resource, create a
	new XRToolsSurfaceAudioType
	
	3) Name - fill in the the surface name to be used
	for the footstep
	
	4) Walk Sounds and HitSound - fill with the desired
	audio files
		
		4)a: Walk Sounds can be multiple ones
