# Basic Movement Demo

This scene demonstrates basic movement providers. Specifically:
 - [Direct Movement](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/direct/)
 - [Turning](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/turn/)
 - [Jumping](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/jump/)
 - [Crouching](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/crouching/)

Numerous test objects have been scattered around the scene that the player can
walk or jump onto to verify the movement works as expected.
