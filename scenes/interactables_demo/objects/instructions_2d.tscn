text = "Interactables Demo


This scene demonstrates interactable objects. The user may control the sliders, levers, joysticks, and wheel by grabbing them and dragging the interactable around. The push-button is activated when a part of the hand enters the button area.

Some objects override the hand poses while the hands are near, such as the buttons which force the hand to point with the index finger.
