# Poke Demo

This scene demonstrates using an XRToolsPoke node to interact with user
interfaces and objects. The XRToolsPoke nodes are attached to the index
finger tips of both hands using BoneAttachment nodes.

The XRToolsPoke node will interact with user interface nodes by firing
the standard pointer_pressed / pointer_moved / pointer_released events.
