## How to Use

Information about how to use this plugin can be found [in our WIKI](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools/wiki).

### Demo

This repository now contains a full demo for XR Tools with the XR Tools add on included in this demo.

After cloning this repository you will need to install the OpenXR plugin for it to work. The OpenXR plugin is not included within this repository.
You can obtain the OpenXR plugin [here](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openxr/releases) or download it from the asset library within Godot.

Note that the demo was created using Godot 3.5.

### XR Tools library

To obtain just the XR Tools library for your own project, please check [releases](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools/releases) or download it from the asset library within Godot.

### Preventing hickups

As many of the functions in this module will hide objects that are later shown as the user performs actions, the user will experience a hickup as Godot compiles the shader used to draw the object on screen.

To combat this you will find a scene in this module called `misc/VR_Common_Shader_Cache.tscn`.
Add this scene as a child node to your ARVRCamera. This will trigger the required shaders being
compiled the first time your main scene loads.
