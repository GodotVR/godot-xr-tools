class_name XRToolsSceneBase
extends Spatial

## Introduction
#
# This is our base scene for all our levels.
# It ensures that we have all bits in place to load
# our scene into our staging scene.

# Emit this signal to let staging know we should return to our menu scene
signal exit_to_main_menu

# Emit this signal to let staging know we should load the specified scene
signal load_scene

## Environment
#
# Here we set the environment we need to set as our world environment
# once our scene is loaded.

	# In order to center our player so the players feet are at the location
	# indicated by p_transform, and having our player looking in the required
	# direction, we must offset this transform using the cameras transform.

	var camera_transform = $ARVROrigin/ARVRCamera.transform
	
	# We obtain our view direction and zero out our height
	var view_direction = camera_transform.basis.z

	var transform : Transform
