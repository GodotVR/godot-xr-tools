## Movement Provider for Flying
##
## @desc:
##     This script provides flying movement for the player. The control parameters
##     are intended to support a wide variety of flight mechanics.
##
##     Pitch and Bearing input devices are selected which produce a "forwards"
##     reference frame. The player controls (forwards/backwards and
##     left/right) are applied in relation to this reference frame.
##
##     The Speed Scale and Traction parameters allow primitive flight where
##     the player is in direct control of their speed (in the reference frame).
##     This produces an effect described as the "Mary Poppins Flying Umbrella".
##
##     The Acceleration, Drag, and Guidance parameters allow for slightly more
##     realisitic flying where the player can accelerate in their reference
##     frame. The drag is applied against the global reference and can be used
##     to construct a terminal velocity.
##
##     The Guidance property attempts to lerp the players velocity into flight
##     forwards direction as if the player had guide-fins or wings.
##
##     The Exclusive property specifies whether flight is exclusive (no further
##     physics effects after flying) or whether additional effects such as
##     the default player gravity are applied.
