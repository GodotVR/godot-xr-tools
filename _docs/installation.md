You will need to install the AR or VR plugin for your device which falls outside of
this guide.

You can install this plugin by:
- installing it from the Godot Asset Library,
- downloading it from the releases page [here](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools/releases),
- cloning the Godot XR Tools repository.

## Installing from the Godot Asset Library

To install from the Godot Asset Library simply select the AssetLib tab in the Godot IDE and search for XR Tools.
Select the Godot XR Tools asset, select Download from the popup window and then install it.
Godot will place the files in the correct folders.

## Downloading from the releases page

When downloading the Godot XR Tools plugin from the releases page be sure to download the `godot-xr-tools.zip` file.
Unzip this file and then copy the `godot-xr-tools/addons/godot-xr-tools` folder into the `addons` folder in your project.
If you do not have an `addons` folder in your project, create it first.

# Cloning the Godot XR Tools repository

Note that the XR Tools repository contains a whole demo setup of the XR Tools plugin so you'll want to copy only the `addons/godot-xr-tools` folder into your project.
