## Introduction
Jog movement allows the player to move by swinging their arms.

## Setup
The jog movement is implemented as a function scene that needs to be added
to the [XROrigin3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_xrorigin3d.html) node. This will add a [PlayerBody](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/player_body/) if necessary.

The following shows a player configuration including jogging:

The functionality works out of the box but can be further configured:
