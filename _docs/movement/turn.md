## Introduction
Turn movement allows the player to turn around. Turning can be configured to be
either smooth or snap to limit motion sickness.

## Setup
The turn movement is implemented as a movement scene that needs to be added
to the controller node whose input we are using. This will add a [PlayerBody](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/player_body/) if
necessary.

The following shows a player configuration including turning:

The functionality works out of the box but can be further configured:

The project can also be configured with default turn settings:
