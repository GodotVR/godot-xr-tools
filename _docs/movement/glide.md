## Introduction
Glide movement allows the player to glide when falling by extending their arms
in a T-pose.

## Setup
The glide movement is implemented as a movement scene that needs to be added
to the [XROrigin3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_xrorigin3d.html) node. This will add a [PlayerBody](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/player_body/) if necessary.

The following shows a player configuration including gliding:

The functionality works out of the box but can be further configured:
