## Introduction
Jump movement allows the player to jump by pressing a button on the controller.

## Setup
The jump movement is implemented as a function scene that needs to be added
to the [XRController3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_xrcontroller3d.html) whose input we are using. This will add a [PlayerBody](https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/player_body/) if
necessary.

So if we want to implement the jump movement feature on the left hand
controller we need to add the scene to the left hand:

Jump velocity is set on the surface the player is standing on. This is achieved
by adding a ground physics node as a child of the physics body and setting the
ground physics properties:
![Jump Physics Configuration]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/jump/jump_physics.png)

> It is also possible to set default ground physics in the PlayerBody node.
