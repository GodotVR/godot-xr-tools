## Introduction
Player movement and world interaction is performed using an XRToolsPlayerBody
node. This node is automatically added to the [XROrigin3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_xrorigin3d.html) whenever a movement
provider node is added.

The player body works out of the box but can be further configured:

See [Physics Layers]({{ site.url }}/docs/physics_layers/) for recommendations on
how to configure physics layers for Godot XR Tools.
